# ü•ê Croissant

Croissant is a Go implementation of the
[Pastry Distrubted Hash Table](http://www.freepastry.org/). Nodes use gRPC to
connect to each other.

Croissant is still a work in progress, and is not recommended for use in
production.

For examples of how to build a Croissant cluster, please see the `examples/`
directory.
